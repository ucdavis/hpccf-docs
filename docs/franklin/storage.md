## Home Directories

All users are allocated 20GB of storage for their home directory.
This space is free and not associated with lab storage quotas.

## Lab Storage Allocations

Research data should be stored on lab storage allocations. 
These allocations are mounted at `/group/[PI_GROUP_NAME]`. N
ote that these directories are mounted as-needed, so your particular allocation might not show up when you run `ls /group`; you will need to access the path directly.
You can find your PI group name by running `groups`: this will output your user name and a name ending in `grp`.
The latter corresponds to the directory name under `/group`, unless otherwise requested by your PI.
