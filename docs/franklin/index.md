Franklin is a high performance computing (HPC) cluster for the [College of Biological Sciences](https://biology.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis.
Its primary use is for research in genetics, genomics, and proteomics, structural biology via cryogenic electron microscopy, computational neuroscience, and generally, the computational biology workflows related to those fields.
Franklin currently consists of 7 AMD :simple-amd: CPU nodes each with 128 physical and 256 logical cores and 1TB of RAM,
9 GPU nodes with a total of 72 Nvidia :simple-nvidia: RTX A4000, RTX A5000, RTX 6000 Ada, and RTX 2080 TI GPUs, and a collection
