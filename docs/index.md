## Using This Documentation

Before contacting HPCCF support, first try searching this documentation.
This site provides information on accessing and interacting with the cluster,
an overview of available software ecosystems, and tutorials for commonly used software and access patterns.
It is split into a **Users** section for end-users and an **Admin** section with information relevant to system
administators.
This documentation is being actively expanded as Franklin's software and userbase grows.

This site is written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
