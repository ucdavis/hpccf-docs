## Separation from the University

Use and access to HPC@UCD resources are contingent on active affiliation with the university as staff, student, faculty,
or possessing an active [TAF](https://taf.ucdavis.edu/). We will notify users when their affiliation with UC Davis has
lapsed, warning them that their account will be deactivated in 1 month unless their affiliation is renewed (via
[TAF](https://taf.ucdavis.edu/) or another mechanism). After 6 months, deactivated account home directories will be
archived and accessible only by [contacting HPC@UCD](../support.md).

## Accessing data from users no longer affiliated with the university.

PIs occasionally need access to data in the home directories of former lab members who are no longer affiliated with the
university. To do so, please [contact HPC@UCD](../support.md) with the user's username and current contact information.
HPC@UCD will contact the user. If we receive the user’s permission, or we do not get a response from the user within 5
business days, we can provide a list of the files in their home directory, and a PI may request access to specific files
from the list.
