# Requesting an Account

HPC accounts are provisioned on a per-cluster basis and granted with the permission of their principal investigator. Accounts that are provisioned under each PI will have access to that PI's purchased resources and their own separate home directory.

Access to HPC clusters is granted via the use of SSH keys. An SSH public key is required to generate an account. For information on creating SSH keys, please visit the [access](https://docs.hpc.ucdavis.edu/general/access/) documentation page.

### HiPPO

The High-Performance Personnel Onboarding (HiPPO) portal can provision resources for the Farm, Franklin, and Peloton HPC clusters. Users can request an account on [HiPPO](https://hippo.ucdavis.edu) by logging in with UC Davis CAS and selecting their PI. 

Users who do not have a PI and are interested in sponsored tiers for Farm can request an account by selecting the IT director for CAES, Adam Getchell, as their PI.

Users who do not have a PI and who are affiliated with the College of Letters and Science can request an sponsored account on Peloton by selecting the IT director for CLAS, Jeremy Phillips as their PI.
