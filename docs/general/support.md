title: HPC@UCD Support
---

To help us provide better and more consistent support, per department policy, requests emailed directly to team members
will not be addressed. Such requests must be submitted through the ticketing system. See below for information.

-   Any general service inquires and all HPC support questions and concerns related to compute and storage
    infrastructure, user account support, and other technical issues must be submitted to the
    [HPC@UCD Help Desk](mailto:hpc-help@ucdavis.edu).

-   Farm cluster support should be directed to [farm-hpc@ucdavis.edu](mailto:farm-hpc@ucdavis.edu).

-   Note, emails sent to the general IT Express email will incur slowdowns as ITX will need to route that ticket to HPC.
