#About HPCCF-High-Performance Computing Core Facility¶
The UC Davis High-Performance Computing Core Facility (HPCCF) is a campus research core facility in the Office of Research specializing in high-performance computing (HPC) systems for research and education.

As part of our mission, we manage high-performance computing services that enable practical innovation at the UC Davis Research Community to enhance the university's competitive advantage.

We manage UC Davis research computing environments that support multiple colleges, departments, and laboratories across the university. As part of our mission, we support a majority of each system, including design, procurement, implementation, maintenance, and administration.

HPCCF currently houses 12 clusters in total. Over 2000 users, more than 20 PB of physical storage, over 50 thousand active processor cores. The resources over the clusters are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Current HPC clusters run on the latest Ubuntu version 22.04. Users can leverage the Job Scheduler called Slurm to process and submit cron jobs.
