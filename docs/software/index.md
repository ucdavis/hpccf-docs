We provide a broad range of software and scientific libraries
for our users.
On our primary clusters, we deploy software with [spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) to foster reproducibility.
Packages installed via spack have automatically generated [modulefiles](modules.md)
available for each package, while our conda-deployed software is deployed in individual,
centrally installed environments which can be loaded via module or activated traditionally.

To request new software, please read the information in our [Software Installation
Policy](https://hpc.ucdavis.edu/software-installation-policy), and submit a request through our
[Software Request Form](https://hpc.ucdavis.edu/form/software-installation-request).

Because spack is our primary installation method, we are far more likely to approve a new piece
of software if it is already available via a spack repo. You can check whether a spack package
for your software already exists [here](https://packages.spack.io/).
