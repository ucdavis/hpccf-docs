title: About
---

This section is for HPC@UCD admins to document our internal infrastructure, processes, and architectures. Although the
information may be of _interest_ to end users, it is not designed or maintained for their consumption; nothing written
here should be confused as an offering of service. For example, although we describe our [Virtual Machine](vms.md)
infrastructure, which we used for hosting a variety of production-essential services for our clusters, we do **not**
offer VM hosting for end users.
